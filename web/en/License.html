It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]</span></p><h2><a name="preamble" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Preamble</span></h2><p><span>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your</span>
<span>freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public</span>
<span>Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change</span>
<span>free software </span>&mdash;<span> to make sure the software is free for all its users.</span></p><p><span>This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some</span>
<span>specially designated software packages</span>&mdash;<span>typically libraries</span>&mdash;<span>of the</span>
<span>Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You</span>
<span>can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether</span>
<span>this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better</span>
<span>strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.</span></p><p><span>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,</span>
<span>not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that</span>
<span>you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge</span>
<span>for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get</span>
<span>it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of</span>
<span>it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do</span>
<span>these things.</span></p><p><span>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</span>
<span>distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these</span>
<span>rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for</span>
<span>you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.</span></p><p><span>For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis</span>
<span>or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave</span>
<span>you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source</span>
<span>code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide</span>
<span>complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them</span>
<span>with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling</span>
<span>it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</span></p><p><span>We protect your rights with a two-step method: </span>
<span>    1. we copyright the library, and </span>
<span>    2. we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission</span>
<span>       to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</span></p><p><span>To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that</span>
<span>there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is</span>
<span>modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know</span>
<span>that what they have is not the original version, so that the original</span>
<span>author&#39;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be</span>
<span>introduced by others.</span></p><p><span>Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of</span>
<span>any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot</span>
<span>effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a</span>
<span>restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that</span>
<span>any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be</span>
<span>consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.</span></p><p><span>Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the</span>
<span>ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser</span>
<span>General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and</span>
<span>is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use</span>
<span>this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those</span>
<span>libraries into non-free programs.</span></p><p><span>When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using</span>
<span>a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a</span>
<span>combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary</span>
<span>General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the</span>
<span>entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General</span>
<span>Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with</span>
<span>the library.</span></p><p><span>We call this license the </span><strong><span>Lesser</span></strong><span> General Public License because it</span>
<span>does Less to protect the user&#39;s freedom than the ordinary General</span>
<span>Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less</span>
<span>of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages</span>
<span>are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many</span>
<span>libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain</span>
<span>special circumstances.</span></p><p><span>For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to</span>
<span>encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes</span>
<span>a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be</span>
<span>allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free</span>
<span>library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this</span>
<span>case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free</span>
<span>software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.</span></p><p><span>In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free</span>
<span>programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of</span>
<span>free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in</span>
<span>non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU</span>
<span>operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating</span>
<span>system.</span></p><p><span>Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the</span>
<span>users&#39; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is</span>
<span>linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run</span>
<span>that program using a modified version of the Library.</span></p><p><span>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</span>
<span>modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a</span>
<strong><span>work based on the library</span></strong><span> and a </span><strong><span>work that uses the library</span></strong><span>.  The</span>
<span>former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must</span>
<span>be combined with the library in order to run.</span></p><h2><a name="gnu-lesser-general-public-license" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</span></h2><h2><a name="terms-and-conditions-for-copying,-distribution-and-modification" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</span></h2><ol start='0' ><li><p><span>This License Agreement applies to any software library or other</span>
<span>program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or</span>
<span>other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of</span>
<span>this Lesser General Public License (also called </span><strong><span>this License</span></strong><span>).</span>
<span>Each licensee is addressed as </span><strong><span>you</span></strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>A </span><strong><span>library</span></strong><span> means a collection of software functions and/or data</span>
<span>prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs</span>
<span>(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</span></p><p><span>The </span><strong><span>Library</span></strong><span>, below, refers to any such software library or work</span>
<span>which has been distributed under these terms.  A </span><strong><span>work based on the</span>
<span>Library</span></strong><span> means either the Library or any derivative work under</span>
<span>copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a</span>
<span>portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated</span>
<span>straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is</span>
<span>included without limitation in the term </span><strong><span>modification</span></strong><span>.)</span></p><p><strong><span>Source code</span></strong><span> for a work means the preferred form of the work for</span>
<span>making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means</span>
<span>all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated</span>
<span>interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation</span>
<span>and installation of the library.</span></p><p><span>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not</span>
<span>covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of</span>
<span>running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from</span>
<span>such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based</span>
<span>on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for</span>
<span>writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does</span>
<span>and what the program that uses the Library does.</span></p></li><li><p><span>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&#39;s</span>
<span>complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that</span>
<span>you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an</span>
<span>appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact</span>
<span>all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any</span>
<span>warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the</span>
<span>Library.</span></p><p><span>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,</span>
<span>and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a</span>
<span>fee.</span></p></li><li><p><span>You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion</span>
<span>of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and</span>
<span>distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1</span>
<span>above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>a) The modified work must itself be a software library.  </span></p></li><li><p><span>b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices</span>
<span>stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.  </span></p></li><li><p><span>c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no</span>
<span>charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.  </span></p></li><li><p><span>d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a</span>
<span>table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses</span>
<span>the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility</span>
<span>is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,</span>
<span>in the event an application does not supply such function or</span>
<span>table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of</span>
<span>its purpose remains meaningful.  </span></p><p><span>(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has</span>
<span>a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the</span>
<span>application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any</span>
<span>application-supplied function or table used by this function must</span>
<span>be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square</span>
<span>root function must still compute square roots.)  </span></p></li></ul><p><span>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If</span>
<span>identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,</span>
<span>and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in</span>
<span>themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those</span>
<span>sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you</span>
<span>distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based</span>
<span>on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</span>
<span>this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the</span>
<span>entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote</span>
<span>it.</span></p><p><span>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest</span>
<span>your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to</span>
<span>exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or</span>
<span>collective works based on the Library.</span></p><p><span>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library</span>
<span>with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of</span>
<span>a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under</span>
<span>the scope of this License.</span></p></li><li><p><span>You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public</span>
<span>License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do</span>
<span>this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so</span>
<span>that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,</span>
<span>instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the</span>
<span>ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify</span>
<span>that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in</span>
<span>these notices.</span></p><p><span>Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for</span>
<span>that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all</span>
<span>subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</span></p><p><span>This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of</span>
<span>the Library into a program that is not a library.</span></p></li><li><p><span>You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or</span>
<span>derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form</span>
<span>under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany</span>
<span>it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which</span>
<span>must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a</span>
<span>medium customarily used for software interchange.</span></p><p><span>If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy</span>
<span>from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the</span>
<span>source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to</span>
<span>distribute the source code, even though third parties are not</span>
<span>compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</span></p></li><li><p><span>A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the</span>
<span>Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or</span>
<span>linked with it, is called a </span><strong><span>work that uses the Library</span></strong><span>.  Such a</span>
<span>work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and</span>
<span>therefore falls outside the scope of this License.</span></p><p><span>However, linking a </span><strong><span>work that uses the Library</span></strong><span> with the Library</span>
<span>creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it</span>
<span>contains portions of the Library), rather than a </span><strong><span>work that uses the</span></strong>
<strong><span>library</span></strong><span>.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.</span>
<span>Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</span></p><p><span>When a </span><strong><span>work that uses the Library</span></strong><span> uses material from a header file</span>
<span>that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a</span>
<span>derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.</span>
<span>Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be</span>
<span>linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The</span>
<span>threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</span></p><p><span>If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data</span>
<span>structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline</span>
<span>functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object</span>
<span>file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative</span>
<span>work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the</span>
<span>Library will still fall under Section 6.)</span></p><p><span>Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may</span>
<span>distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.</span>
<span>Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,</span>
<span>whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.</span></p></li><li><p><span>As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or</span>
<span>link a </span><strong><span>work that uses the Library</span></strong><span> with the Library to produce a</span>
<span>work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work</span>
<span>under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit</span>
<span>modification of the work for the customer&#39;s own use and reverse</span>
<span>engineering for debugging such modifications.</span></p><p><span>You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the</span>
<span>Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by</span>
<span>this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work</span>
<span>during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the</span>
<span>copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference</span>
<span>directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one</span>
<span>of these things:</span></p><ul><li><span>a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding</span>
<span>machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever</span>
<span>changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under</span>
<span>Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked</span>
<span>with the Library, with the complete machine-readable </span><strong><span>work that</span>
<span>uses the Library</span></strong><span>, as object code and/or source code, so that the</span>
<span>user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified</span>
<span>executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood</span>
<span>that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the</span>
<span>Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application</span>
<span>to use the modified definitions.)</span></li><li><span>b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the</span>
<span>Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a</span>
<span>copy of the library already present on the user&#39;s computer system,</span>
<span>rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)</span>
<span>will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if</span>
<span>the user installs one, as long as the modified version is</span>
<span>interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.</span></li><li><span>c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at</span>
<span>least three years, to give the same user the materials</span>
<span>specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more</span>
<span>than the cost of performing this distribution.</span></li><li><span>d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy</span>
<span>from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above</span>
<span>specified materials from the same place.</span></li><li><span>e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these</span>
<span>materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.</span></li></ul><p><span>For an executable, the required form of the </span><strong><span>work that uses the</span>
<span>Library</span></strong><span> must include any data and utility programs needed for</span>
<span>reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,</span>
<span>the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is</span>
<span>normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major</span>
<span>components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on</span>
<span>which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies</span>
<span>the executable.</span></p><p><span>It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license</span>
<span>restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally</span>
<span>accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot</span>
<span>use both them and the Library together in an executable that you</span>
<span>distribute.</span></p></li><li><p><span>You may place library facilities that are a work based on the</span>
<span>Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library</span>
<span>facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined</span>
<span>library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on</span>
<span>the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise</span>
<span>permitted, and provided that you do these two things:</span></p><ul><li><span>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work</span>
<span>based on the Library, uncombined with any other library</span>
<span>facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the</span>
<span>Sections above.</span></li><li><span>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact</span>
<span>that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining</span>
<span>where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</span></li></ul></li><li><p><span>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute</span>
<span>the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any</span>
<span>attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or</span>
<span>distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your</span>
<span>rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,</span>
<span>or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses</span>
<span>terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</span></p></li><li><p><span>You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</span>
<span>signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or</span>
<span>distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are</span>
<span>prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by</span>
<span>modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the</span>
<span>Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</span>
<span>all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying</span>
<span>the Library or works based on it.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the</span>
<span>Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the</span>
<span>original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library</span>
<span>subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further</span>
<span>restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.</span>
<span>You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with</span>
<span>this License.</span></p></li><li><p><span>If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent</span>
<span>infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),</span>
<span>conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</span>
<span>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</span>
<span>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot</span>
<span>distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</span>
<span>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you</span>
<span>may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent</span>
<span>license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by</span>
<span>all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then</span>
<span>the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to</span>
<span>refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.</span></p><p><span>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any</span>
<span>particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,</span>
<span>and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</span></p><p><span>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any</span>
<span>patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any</span>
<span>such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the</span>
<span>integrity of the free software distribution system which is</span>
<span>implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made</span>
<span>generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed</span>
<span>through that system in reliance on consistent application of that</span>
<span>system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing</span>
<span>to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot</span>
<span>impose that choice.</span></p><p><span>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to</span>
<span>be a consequence of the rest of this License.</span></p></li><li><p><span>If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in</span>
<span>certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the</span>
<span>original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add</span>
<span>an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,</span>
<span>so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus</span>
<span>excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if</span>
<span>written in the body of this License.</span></p></li><li><p><span>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new</span>
<span>versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.</span>
<span>Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,</span>
<span>but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</span></p><p><span>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library</span>
<span>specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and</span>
<strong><span>any later version</span></strong><span>, you have the option of following the terms and</span>
<span>conditions either of that version or of any later version published by</span>
<span>the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a</span>
<span>license version number, you may choose any version ever published by</span>
<span>the Free Software Foundation.</span></p></li><li><p><span>If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free</span>
<span>programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,</span>
<span>write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is</span>
<span>copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free</span>
<span>Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our</span>
<span>decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status</span>
<span>of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing</span>
<span>and reuse of software generally.</span></p></li></ol><h3><a name="no-warranty" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>NO WARRANTY</span></h3><ol start='15' ><li><span>BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO</span>
